# CougarCS Dev

CougarCS is the largest student-run Computer Science organization at the University of Houston. At CougarCS, our mission is to smoothly transition our inexperienced members into young professionals by the end of their degree and to provide support and assistance to members who struggle academically or who need career guidance.

## Purpose:

Current website is outdated, with our new design we drive members to a better user experience and a more aesthetic site that will drive our purpose to be the best CS organization at the University of Houston.

CougarCS-Web is the revamp version of the current cougarcs.com website.

# Getting Started

- ## Requirements
  - [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) version 12+
  - We use [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) as our package manager

  - The local server will start on [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173)
- ## Linting
  - We use ESLint to fix styling and to enforce rules.
  - Run `npm run eslint-check` to check linting issues in the code.
  - Run `npm run eslint-fix` to auto-lint the code.
  - ESLint runs on Github Action. ESLint must pass before pushing or during a pull request.

<!-- - ## Testing
  - We use [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) to do E2E testing
  - To run the tests locally:
      - Start the application locally using ```yarn start```
      - There are two ways you can run the test:
          - Running the test in the command line ```yarn test```
          - Running test using Cypress GUI ```yarn test:ui```
  - The tests are part of the CI/CD pipeline, if the test fails the CI/CD fails
  - Learn more about testing using [Cypress](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/overview/why-cypress) -->

- ## Project Structure
  - Images and other assets are in `src/assets/`
  - The `src/pages/` directory will have the pages based on the routing. (Currently it is single page)
  - The `src/components/` will hold the components that make up the page.
